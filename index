",UNFPA (n.d.). 2023 Annual Report - Bangladesh
"To promote positive changes in gender norms, UNFPA, in coordination with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA), provided orientation to 190 government officials and NGO staff in two priority districts on the Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) plan and activities. This action aimed to enhance local capacity for implementing GBV prevention programmes, though limited financial resources remain a challenge for NGOs. ",UNFPA (n.d.). 2022 Annual Report_Bangladesh
"Regarding women with disabilities, UNFPA produced a scoping report on the capacity development of their caregivers, identifying action points for advocacy. However, a significant gap was noted where nearly zero percentage of staff in Women Friendly Spaces (WFS) received dedicated training on disability inclusion, which limits the effective uptake of services by women with disabilities.

According to the findings of this 2023 baseline survey, 15.9% of the surveyed population residing in the 10 UNFPA priority districts possessed awareness regarding the fundamental causes and repercussions of gender-based violence. The survey also identified the root causes of GBV as complex, involving cultural norms, gender inequality, economic disparities, and substance abuse. Notably, there were significant regional variations in awareness levels. his disaggregated data underscored the necessity for targeted interventions to address these regional disparities and enhance knowledge gains, especially in areas with lower baseline awareness.

Climate Change Displacement and Women’s Access to SRHR•        Women displaced by slow-onset disasters (e.g., riverbank erosion) face disproportionately higher barriers to ANC, PNC, and skilled birth attendance.•        Only 3.1% of riverine-displaced women received continuum of maternal care, compared to nearly 27% in non-displaced areas.•        Quality ANC and C-section rates are alarmingly low among the displaced, with severe affordability and accessibility issues.•        The study informs targeted interventions by mapping service delivery gaps and quantifying the compounded vulnerabilities of displaced women.b. Slum Populations and Urban Exclusions•        Significant demographic shifts: 32% of the population is urban, with slum growth outpacing infrastructure and services.•        Education, employment, early marriage, and NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) vulnerabilities are deeply entrenched.•        Slum dwellers, while excluded from public services, are active agents in the informal economy, demonstrating resilience and adaptive capacities.•        Findings inform holistic urban strategies that go beyond Dhaka-centric planning, emphasizing inclusive, decentralized, and gender-sensitive responses.c. Socioeconomic Exclusion of the Transgender Population•        Over 80% experience third-party violence, both in public and private spaces.•        Only 7% have completed HSC education, and most rely on insecure, informal livelihoods (badhai, sex work).•        Financial exclusion is stark: only 2% access formal credit; social protection coverage is negligible.•        High prevalence of mental health distress, PTSD, and health vulnerabilities, including 9% HIV positivity.•        The findings shape advocacy for legal recognition, targeted safety net inclusion, and community-sensitive health services.d. Investment Case to End Adolescent Pregnancy and Child Marriage•        Scaling interventions could prevent XX* million child marriages and XX million adolescent pregnancies by 2050.•        Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) range from XX to XX, emphasizing high returns from strategic investments in life skills, norm change, CSE, and economic incentives.•        Outcomes include averting XX maternal deaths, enhancing school completion, and unlocking $XX billion in economic benefits.•        This case directly feeds into policy dialogues with GED, MoWCA, and Parliament, promoting alignment with SDG 5.3 and national adolescent policies.e. Beneficiary Profiling in Disaster-Affected Areas•        Flood, cyclone, and landslide-affected districts (e.g., Kurigram, Bandarban, Cox’s Bazar, Noakhali).•        Criteria included: households with pregnant/lactating women, female-headed, elderly, disabled, and socially vulnerable groups.•        The protocol ensures data-secure digital enumeration, supports resource allocation, and reduces duplication across UNFPA and partner responses.•        This baseline supports real-time analytics for shock-responsive programming in climate-vulnerable zones.f.

",A Thematic Overview
" 1. UNFPA offered full scholarships to ethnic minority girls for midwifery education to increase healthcare access and culturally appropriate services in remote areas.2. Community-level identification mechanisms, fistula corners in hospitals, and screening camps are used to find fistula patients, especially in hard-to-reach and marginalized communities.3. UNFPA supports training community health workers for household visits to identify potential fistula cases in marginalized and hard-to-reach areas.4. UNFPA engages community fistula advocates and ambassadors to support the identification of fistula cases  .5. The ""Komolful Pharmacy"" initiative trains female pharmacists in urban areas, expanding SRH service access, counseling, and referrals for women, including child marriage prevention.  6. Community mobilization efforts, using community health workers, raise awareness and facilitate referrals for maternal health services in hard-to-reach areas.7. UNFPA is supporting the development of a digital referral system and mobile medical teams to reach hard-to-reach populations, including those in coastal, char, and haor areas, and urban slums.8.

" 7.  The Santal Project, initiated in June 2020, has built trust within the Santal community, leading to increased participation in health programs and institutional deliveries due to comfortable interactions with Santal community health workers. 8.  A systematic approach is in place to monitor the reach to young people in humanitarian settings. The Youth Working Group has started a database to track which organizations work where, covering how many adolescents and youth are reached, which helps identify gaps in program coverage across camps. 9.  Awareness campaigns and life skills education are provided in camps and host communities. Efforts also include providing livelihood opportunities and paid volunteer roles to young people, which can contribute to decreasing child marriage. 10. SRHR services are integrated into government health facilities for sex workers within the Unified Budget, Results, and Accountability Framework (URAF) grant. Advocacy for transgender people and sex workers in various forums contributes to HIV prevention efforts. 11. There is a recognized need to pay more attention to marginalized groups such as women engaged in sex work and people with disabilities. People with disabilities often face discrimination and lack financial support, with calls for entrepreneurship training and better accessibility to services. 12. Issues include limited availability of reproductive services in disaster-prone coastal areas and vulnerable housing. Recommendations include climate-resilient infrastructure for health facilities and local planning for emergency response. 13. UNFPA and its partners conduct training on foundational humanitarian principles, including GBV prevention. Midwives receive training in ANC, PNC, and normal delivery services to improve case management, though consistent mentorship is crucial. 14.

Discussions are also underway to incorporate SRHR into the Ministry of Disaster Management and Response's development plan. 15. Bangladesh has robust laws, but weaknesses exist in implementation and financing for gender equality initiatives, leading to persistent violence against women and girls and limited access to essential services. 16.

"1.  Alignment exists on paper but is incomplete in practice: UNFPA is active in national/UN coordination spaces and co-chairs several working groups, but the main program document lacks clarity for key crises (e.g., Rohingya). National targets and reporting misalign in some thematic areas. 2.  Active, regular participation enables adaptation and reduces duplication. UNFPA and partners participate in national/district working groups, sectoral committees, and joint assessments, leading to inclusion of youth and marginalized indicators in national needs assessments and improved complementarity with other agencies (e.g., education, GBV, youth). 3.  Comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach in design and delivery. Programs address cross-cutting needs in education, health, protection, and livelihoods; peer educators are used for sustainability. Partnerships extend to government, CSOs, private sector, and local community organizations, ensuring interventions evolve with emerging needs (e.g., climate-affected groups, hill tracts, RMG sector). 4.  The 10th Country Program (2022-2026) aims to contribute to the three transformative results (reduction of maternal mortality, unmet need for family planning, and gender-based violence/child marriage). UNFPA co-leads the UNSDCF SP5 working group on gender equality and integrates health activities into government financing. 5.  UNFPA engages in monthly District Coordination Meetings and co-chairs working groups on SRH and GBV at the district level with government and CBOs. Discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Response to integrate SRHR into their future development plan. 6.  UNFPA collaborates with private sector partners for family planning in RMG factories and is transitioning its family planning focus from population control to a broader welfare approach that includes maternal and child health and pregnancy planning. UNFPA also advocates for integrated interventions within government systems for long-term sustainability. 7.  While UNFPA’s country program document states alignment with national strategies and SDGs, it lacks specific guidelines or mention of the Rohingya crisis, creating a disconnect between national targets and humanitarian response.

"1. ToCs form the conceptual backbone for adaptation, but their practical integration is variable. Four ToCs guide the country programme, providing a framework for aligning with evolving needs (e.g., youth, climate, migration). Strategic discussions have resulted in meaningful changes, such as advocating for and integrating youth-specific indicators in multisector needs assessments, after identifying gaps in youth data. However, evidence of ToCs directly driving field-level adaptation to all megatrends is limited, with climate and migration addressed more superficially than gender and youth. 2.  Inter-agency and inter-sectoral coordination is robust, with established platforms facilitating consistent strategic direction. National and district-level groups (e.g., Inter-Sector Coordination Group, Youth Working Group) ensure regular dialogue, joint targeting, and reduced duplication. Notable improvements include the integration of youth, gender, and disability indicators across multiple needs assessments, and strategic partnerships with other UN agencies to fill gaps (e.g., SRHR in education, mental health). However, evidence of regular, effective dialogue on issues like ageing and climate is weaker. 3.  Alignment of ToCs with national plans and international frameworks is inconsistent, especially in humanitarian work. While ToCs reference the 8th Five Year Plan, SDGs, and ICPD PoA, the main Country Programme Document lacks explicit, actionable guidelines for the Rohingya response and does not consistently “hit” national or sectoral targets. The humanitarian context (e.g., refugees, climate-affected) often operates with parallel or fragmented alignment. 4.  Intent for systematic LNOB/disability inclusion is clear, but implementation is uneven. Examples: persons with disabilities are engaged as data collectors and have reserved seats on committees, but exclusion from meetings and lack of entitlements persist. Electronic registration and peer-led models support LNOB in youth, but ageing and climate vulnerabilities are not addressed with the same rigor. Humanitarian needs assessments integrate youth and gender, but do not fully address intersectional needs (e.g., elderly, climate refugees, persons with complex disabilities). 5.  UNFPA actively coordinates with other UN agencies, such as UNICEF, to avoid duplication in education programs. UNFPA complements UNICEF's Myanmar curriculum by providing comprehensive sexual education, menstrual health management, and mental health awareness, which are missing from the standard curriculum. 6.  The country program documentation notes alignment with the 8th Five Year Plan, UNSDCF, and UNFPA's transformative goals. However, the program document lacks specific guidelines or mention of the Rohingya crisis, despite significant UNFPA contribution, creating a disconnect between national targets and humanitarian data.
